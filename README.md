link-validator
==============

Will recursively validate each link on a specified website, and those of its children.

## Usage

Simply modify the link included in validate.py to a link of your choosing, and run the script. Recursion depth defaults to 2, but can be set in the get_broken_links function arguments. Things slow down a lot as this increases, so start low

Note that the coloured terminal output will probably only work on Mac OS and Linux
